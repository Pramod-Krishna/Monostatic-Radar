# ***_Monostatic Radar_***

***

The design goal of this pulse radar system is to detect non-fluctuating targets with 1sqm RCS at a distance up to 5km from the radar with a range resolution of 50m. The desired performance index is a probability of detection (Pd) of 0.9 and probability of false alarm (Pfa) below 1e-6. 
We choose a rectangular waveform, and make a few assumptions:
* The only noise present at the receiver is the thermal noise, so there is no clutter involved in this simulation
* There are 3 stationary, non-fluctuating targets in space
